# Spotify API clone

I did this project from a [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xrko3GpYoU&t=3571s) to better get to understand
Next.js 12, Middlewar and how to handle authenticated user access, as well as state management.

Because I wanted to focus on learning Next/React and Hooks, rather than styling, I decided not to use CSS modules or styled-components,
but used TailwindCSS, so I could get it up fast.

## Stack
